- visualisation.mlx for only one value of the parameter, you can see the space-time reconstructed dynamics for each method
- range_where_improve.mlx to see the results of the hybrid method for different parameter values

Please go to https://github.com/MLDS-NUS/KoopmanDL if you want to use neural network dictionary and change the path of your python installation. Otherwise, please choose 0 for neural network in the dictionary.
